# API Design

## Purpose

Define expectations for stable, understandable, and secure APIs.

## Mandatory requirements

- APIs MUST use consistent resource naming and documented versioning.
- Existing clients MUST remain compatible unless an approved migration exists.
- Error responses MUST be structured, stable, and actionable.
- Collection APIs MUST define pagination behavior.
- Mutating APIs SHOULD support idempotency where retries are expected.
- Protected APIs MUST enforce authentication and authorization.
- Public or cross-team APIs MUST maintain OpenAPI or equivalent documentation.
- Inputs MUST be validated and contracts MUST remain stable across releases.

## Recommended practices

- Use rate limiting for abuse-prone or resource-intensive APIs.
- Document deprecations with timelines and replacement paths.
- Prefer explicit request and response schemas.

## Verification

Reviewers inspect API documentation, compatibility notes, validation paths, error schemas, and authentication or authorization coverage.
